# ImageColouriser
The implementation is designed for training the model and displaying an understanding of the pix2pix paper and designing of GANs, and results in more accurate results 
as the number of epochs is increased, stabilizing around 200 epochs. The images displayed are a suboptimal version of results due to a smaller number of epochs run
and the number of layers being limited in number, due to hardware constraints
